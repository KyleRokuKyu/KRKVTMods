  "Description": "A full world gen overhaul with new biomes, oceans, rivers, and more!

New Biomes:
Oceanic - A beach/tropical shore line
Marsh Lands - Very damp, swampy, kinda terrible to have to cross sometimes
Mesa - Tall, sandstone plateau
Mountainous - A large mountain range
Dunes - Desertous and slopey
Arctic Ocean - An ocean in the arctic with ice bergs

New Per Biome Settings:
RiverDispersion - How twisty or broken up rivers tend to be
RiverSize - How chonky and wide the rivers tend to be
WaterColor - Hex value for the color of the water
MinimumHeight - The lowest this biome can generate land
MaximumHeight - The highest this biome can generate land
Probability - If there's a tie for which biome should spawn based on Temp/Humidity, this determines how likely this biome is to be chosen
Rivers - Whether or not this biome has rivers
ExcludeFromSpawn - Whether or not this biome should be considered when creating the initial spawn area (Oceans would be terrible to spawn in.)

New World Settings (In the biomesettings.biome file):
TemperatureGeneration - How temperature is calculated. Latitude clamps it at both poles, LatitudeWrapped will continuously cycle hotter and colder as you change latitudes, and Default is the vanilla random temperature (Can generate snow next to deserts)
Water - Whether or not this world has water
Rivers - Whether or not this world has rivers
PlanetSize - How large the temperature gradients span
BiggerElevationChanges - Whether or not to use the default heights and bumpiness generation

----------------------------------

If you aren't already,
I HIGHLY recommend using F5's Biome Recolor mods with Biome-izer
It makes the vanilla biomes look so much more pleasing to the eye
